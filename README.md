# 3D Forest House Project

Welcome to the 3D Forest House project repository! This project showcases a 3D model of a forest house rendered using Three.js.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a visually appealing 3D representation of a forest house environment using WebGL technology. The project utilizes the following components:

- **Three.js**: A JavaScript library for creating and rendering 3D graphics in a web browser.
- **GLTFLoader**: A Three.js loader used to load 3D models in the GLTF (GL Transmission Format) format.
- **Ambient Lighting**: Implementation of ambient and directional lighting to enhance the visual quality of the scene.
